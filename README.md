# Framer Motion Project

This project is a showcase of the power of combining React, Vite, and Framer Motion. 

The main highlight of this project is the use of Framer Motion to create complex, high-performance animations and gestures. The project includes a parallax effect implemented in the `Parallax1.jsx` component, demonstrating the capabilities of Framer Motion.

The project is structured for easy navigation, with the main application logic in `App.jsx`, additional components in the `Components` directory, and assets in the `assets` directory. The `main.jsx` file serves as the entry point of the application.

Scripts are provided for development, building the project for production, linting, and previewing the built project. 

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository, install the dependencies with npm, and start the development server.
